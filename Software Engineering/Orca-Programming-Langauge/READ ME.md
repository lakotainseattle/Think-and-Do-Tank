### Development Talk

### Development Location

### Goals
- Be modular. For example, #garbage_collector, #shader_programming, object orientation, etc should be language modules.
- Be easily extensible. This can be achieved with a reserved word system that marks any word as reserved if certain lexical rule is applied (i.e. all capitals, quoted with `, etc).
- Be multi-paradigm. It should support the imperative and functional paradigms, the structured and object-oriented paradigms, and other paradigms like text generation, state machine, grammar expression, etc.
- name is to be simple to type and find, try searching reddit for #Cpp, it only accepts C

### Development Guidelines
- Use any programming language
- Code in a modular, easily extensible and re-usable fashion
- If you have any Questions or Ideas please go to Development Talk
- If you are implementing a feature, working on this project, please say what you are working on in the Dev Talk and or open an issue and say you will work on the issue. Please do this so we don't waste time doing a feature someone else is already doing.
- Fork project, make your changes, test them, if they work, push to your fork, and then open pull request to merge your fork to the main repo main-branch.

### Idea Creation and Acceptance Rules
- Ideas go in Ideas.md in sub-folder Ideas. 
- Ideas are to be disccused on the discord. 
- An idea must be in line with the goals of this project unless the idea is to change those goals. 
- Once an idea is voted on and is agreed upon by all working on the language, it becomes offical and will be moved from Ideas to Design/Features section of this doc.

Should we have a contributer list, or let github auto do that?
Should we have a dev-branch?
